/**
 * Shared lock/unlock for handlers whose lock differs only by endpoint and
 * name field. `lock` leaves the session stateful (the caller must unlock).
 * `unlock` runs the release inside a stateful request — older BASIS (#106)
 * only accepts UNLOCK while stateful — then restores stateless. The handler's
 * state shape (including the ADT `unlockResult`) is built by `strategy.release`
 * and returned unchanged. See the spec's IAdtLockable obligations — idempotent
 * unlock is a TARGET, not implemented here, and is left to the per-endpoint
 * probe + adaptation rule of the full-migration plan.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY byte-identical to the current handlers, including the failure
 * path: if `acquire`/`release` throws, the session is left as-is (stateful) and
 * the error propagates — exactly as today. Failure/abandonment handling is
 * DISTRIBUTED and this capability owns none of it:
 *   - the consumer largely owns lock/unlock atomicity (it decides when to lock
 *     and unlock);
 *   - adt-clients' `LockRegistry.unlockAll()` is a disposal safety net that
 *     raw-releases abandoned locks — deliberately WITHOUT toggling the session,
 *     because `unlockAll()` manages the session once for the whole batch;
 *   - the operation chain's create/update catch blocks also call
 *     setSessionType('stateless').
 * Adding a try/finally here would change behaviour and relocate responsibility
 * across those layers, so the atom-level "restore stateless on failure"
 * contract is deferred to the behavioural-conformance work (same bucket as
 * activate/check error unification), where all three layers are reconciled
 * rather than double-cleaned.
