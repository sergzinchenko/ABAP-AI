## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.8] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Requires `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` `^1.2.0` (was `^1.0.5`), which gives every callback
  server one owner and one release point. A callback port is now held for the duration of a
  login and nothing longer: it is released when the login ends — by success, failure, timeout
  or cancellation — and the promise settles only once the socket is actually free.

  This matters here because `AuthBroker` classifies a failure by matching
  `/authentication timeout|browser authentication|already in use/i`. Before this,
  `already in use` could be reported while the port was still in the process of being
  released, or long after a previous login had abandoned it. The message is unchanged; what
  changed is that it is now always true when it appears.

- **`engines.node` is now `>=18.2.0`** (was `>=18.0.0`), matching the floor `auth-providers`
  requires for `server.closeAllConnections()`.

### Notes
- No API change. The bump is a realignment: consumers get the fixed callback lifetime without
  touching their own code.


## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Moved `tsx` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`. `tsx` is only used by the `generate-env` dev script; it is never imported by the shipped `dist/` code (the `mcp-auth`/`mcp-sso` bins run compiled JS via node). Having it in `dependencies` pulled `tsx → esbuild → @esbuild/<platform>` into every consumer's production and global install, triggering an `allow-scripts`/ignored-build-script prompt for esbuild's postinstall on Windows/macOS package managers. Consumers no longer install esbuild.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- `getToken`: no longer retries via the `serviceKey` strategy after the `session` strategy fails with an *interactive* browser-login error (timeout / `BROWSER_AUTH_ERROR`). Both strategies call the same `tokenProvider.getTokens()`, so the retry could not succeed and merely started a duplicate browser login on the same redirect port — surfacing a misleading `Port <n> is already in use` instead of the real cause. Transient/non-interactive session failures still fall through to the `serviceKey` attempt.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- `mcp-auth` subcommands: `auth-code`, `oidc`, `saml2-pure`, `saml2-bearer` (delegates to `mcp-sso`).
- `mcp-auth saml2-bearer` requires `--dev` and warns otherwise (in progress).
- `mcp-sso` subcommands: `oidc`, `saml2`, `bearer`.
- `mcp-sso`: `--saml-metadata` to resolve XSUAA token alias endpoint from SP metadata.
- `tests/sso-demo`: service key helper script with `--service/--key/--out` overrides.

### Changed
- `mcp-sso`: allow `--token-endpoint` with `--service-key` for SAML bearer.
- Docs and test scripts updated for new subcommands.
- Bumped `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` to `^1.0.5`.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `mcp-sso`: ensure auth config is seeded for broker and avoid writing placeholder secrets.


## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `mcp-sso`: prompt for passcode when not provided and tighten CLI typing.


## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- New `mcp-sso` CLI for SSO flows (OIDC browser/device/password/token_exchange and SAML2 bearer/pure).

### Changed
- Bumped `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` to ^1.0.2.



## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Include `tsconfig.cli.json` in git so `npm run build` works in CI.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Persist SAML session cookies when token providers return `tokenType: 'saml'`.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **Packaging**: Build runs on `npm pack` to ensure `dist/bin/mcp-auth.js` is up to date in the tarball.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **CLI**: Remove legacy wrapper; only compiled `dist/bin/mcp-auth.js` remains (no runtime `spawn`).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **CLI**: Ship a compiled `mcp-auth` binary in `dist/bin` and point `bin` to it (no runtime `tsx`).
- **Build**: Added `tsconfig.cli.json` to compile the CLI during build.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **CLI**: Resolve local `tsx` via its `bin` entry so global installs work without `npx` or global `tsx`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **CLI**: Run via local `tsx` CLI using Node to avoid platform-specific spawn issues (no `npx`/`.cmd`).
- **Build**: Use local `tsc` and `biome` binaries directly to avoid `npx` resolving the wrong package.

### Documentation
- **README**: Clarify that `mcp-auth` uses local dependencies and does not require global `tsx`.

### Documentation
- **README**: Clarify that `mcp-auth` uses local dependencies and does not require global `tsx`.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **CLI**: Auto-detect service key format (ABAP vs XSUAA) based on content structure
- **CLI**: Support for "credentials" wrapper in service keys (common in SAP BTP)
- **CLI**: Fallback parsing when stores fail to parse service key
- **CLI**: Log authorization URL and redirect URI for easier debugging
- **Documentation**: Added `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code project guidance

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores` from `^0.2.10` to `^0.3.0`

### Fixed
- **CLI**: Filter placeholder `<SERVICE_URL>` from output when not available

## [0.2.17] - 2025-12-31

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Depend on the published `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker` `^0.2.17` package to keep the CLI wiring aligned with the latest release.
- **Dependencies**: Bump `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.2.15` so consumers pick up the current interface contracts.

## [0.2.16] - 2025-12-31

### Changed
- **CLI**: Changed default authentication flow from `client_credentials` to `authorization_code`
  - Both ABAP and XSUAA now use `authorization_code` by default (browser-based OAuth2)
  - Default browser is `auto` (tries to open browser, falls back to showing URL)
  - Added `--credential` flag for `client_credentials` flow (special cases)
  - `--browser none` shows URL in console and waits for callback (no browser opened)
- **CLI**: Updated help text and examples to reflect new defaults

### Fixed
- **CLI**: Fixed process hanging after successful token retrieval by adding explicit `process.exit(0)`

## [0.2.15] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **CLI**: Remove duplicate `authConfig` declaration in `mcp-auth.ts` that caused esbuild/tsx to fail with "symbol already declared" error

## [0.2.14] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Structured logging**: Added detailed logging throughout `AuthBroker` for better debugging and observability
  - Logs broker initialization with configuration details
  - Logs token retrieval operations with formatted tokens (start...end format)
  - Logs token persistence with expiration dates in readable format
  - Logs session state checks with token and refresh token information
  - Uses `formatToken()` and `formatExpirationDate()` utilities for consistent formatting
- **Token formatting utilities**: Added `formatExpirationDate()` function to `utils/formatting.ts` for readable date/time formatting (e.g., "2025-12-25 19:21:27 UTC")
- **Test configuration**: Added `forceExit: true` to `jest.config.js` to prevent test hanging after completion

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` from `^0.2.8` to `^0.2.10`
- **Dependencies**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores` from `^0.2.9` to `^0.2.10`
- **Logging format**: All token logging now uses formatted tokens (shows first 25 and last 25 characters, skipping middle)
- **Logging format**: All expiration date logging now uses readable date/time format instead of raw timestamps

### Fixed
- **Test hanging**: Fixed issue where tests would hang after completion by adding `forceExit: true` to Jest configuration

## [0.2.13] - 2025-12-26

### Changed
- **Token lifecycle management**: Broker now always calls `provider.getTokens()` instead of validating tokens itself. Provider handles all token lifecycle operations internally (validation, refresh, login). Consumer doesn't need to know about token issues - provider manages everything automatically.
- **Removed token validation step**: Removed Step 1 (Token Validation) from broker flow. Broker no longer checks token validity before calling provider - provider decides what to do based on token state.
- **Simplified broker logic**: Broker is now a thin wrapper that always delegates to provider. Provider is responsible for token lifecycle management.

### Removed
- **`validateExistingToken()` method**: Removed internal token validation method. Broker no longer validates tokens - provider handles this internally via `getTokens()`.

### Fixed
- **Compatibility with auth-providers 0.2.8**: Removed dependency on deprecated `refreshTokenFromServiceKey()` method from token providers. Broker now exclusively uses `getTokens()` method which handles all token lifecycle operations internally. This ensures compatibility with stateful token providers that manage refresh/re-auth internally.

## [0.2.12] - 2025-12-25

### Changed
- **Auth flow**: Broker now relies on `ITokenProvider.getTokens()` with no parameters and expects providers to manage refresh/re-auth internally.
- **Constructor**: `tokenProvider` is required and `allowBrowserAuth` is supported for non-interactive flows.
- **Docs**: Updated usage/architecture/export docs to reflect provider injection, new flow, and CLI usage.

## [0.2.11] - 2025-12-23

### Changed
- **mcp-auth CLI**: Reworked to use AuthBroker + stores with env-first refresh fallback to service key.
- **Token provider wiring**: AuthBroker now guards optional token provider methods before invoking them.
- **Docs**: Added CLI usage details for mcp-auth in README and usage guide.

### Updated
- **Dependencies**: Bumped `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to ^0.2.9 and `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` to latest.

## [0.2.10] - 2025-12-22

### Changed
- **Biome Migration**: Migrated from ESLint/Prettier to Biome for linting and formatting
  - Added `@biomejs/biome` as dev dependency
  - Added `lint`, `lint:check`, and `format` scripts to package.json
  - Integrated Biome check into build process (`npx biome check src --diagnostic-level=error`)
  - Replaced `unknown` with `any` in catch blocks (Biome requirement)
  - Added `ErrorWithCode` type for better error type safety
  - Refactored `getToken()` method into smaller private methods for better maintainability:
    - `loadSessionData()` - loads session connection and authorization configs
    - `getServiceUrl()` - gets serviceUrl from session or service key store
    - `getUaaCredentials()` - gets UAA credentials from session or service key
    - `saveTokenToSession()` - saves token and config to session
    - `initializeSessionFromServiceKey()` - Step 0: initializes session from service key
    - `validateExistingToken()` - Step 1: validates existing token
    - `refreshTokenFromSession()` - Step 2a: refreshes token from session
    - `refreshTokenFromServiceKey()` - Step 2b: refreshes token from service key

### Fixed
- Fixed type safety issues by replacing `unknown` with `any` in error handling
- Removed unnecessary type assertions by using `ErrorWithCode` type
- Improved code organization and readability through method extraction

## [0.2.9] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **`createTokenRefresher()` Method**: New factory method to create `ITokenRefresher` for dependency injection
  - Returns `ITokenRefresher` implementation for a specific destination
  - `getToken()` - returns cached token if valid, otherwise refreshes
  - `refreshToken()` - forces token refresh and saves to session store
  - Designed to be injected into `JwtAbapConnection` via DI
  - Enables connections to handle 401/403 transparently without knowing auth internals

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.2.5`
  - New `ITokenRefresher` interface for token management DI
  - Simplified `IAbapConnection` interface (consumer-facing methods only)

### Exports
- Re-export `ITokenRefresher` type from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` for convenience

## [0.2.8] - 2025-12-21

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores` to `^0.2.8`
  - EnvFileSessionStore now persists JWT tokens back to .env file after token refresh
  - Removed duplicate BTP stores (now aliases to XSUAA equivalents)

## [0.2.7] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Headless Browser Mode**: Added `browser: 'headless'` option for SSH and remote sessions
  - Logs authentication URL and waits for manual callback
  - Ideal for environments without display (SSH, Docker, CI/CD)
  - Differs from `'none'` which rejects immediately (for automated tests)

### Changed
- **Documentation Update**: Updated browser option documentation to clarify `headless` vs `none` modes

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.2.4` for headless browser mode support
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` to `^0.2.3` (devDependency, tests only) for headless mode implementation

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- **`allowBrowserAuth` Option**: New configuration option to control browser-based authentication
  - When `allowBrowserAuth: false`, broker throws `BROWSER_AUTH_REQUIRED` error instead of blocking on browser auth
  - Useful for headless/non-interactive environments (e.g., MCP stdio transport with Cline)
  - Error includes `code: 'BROWSER_AUTH_REQUIRED'` and `destination` property for programmatic handling
  - Broker still works with valid session tokens or refresh tokens when browser auth is disabled

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` to `^0.2.2` for automatic port selection, improved server shutdown, and process termination cleanup
  - Browser auth server now automatically finds an available port if the requested port is in use
  - Improved server shutdown ensures ports are properly freed after authentication completes
  - Prevents `EADDRINUSE` errors when multiple stdio servers run simultaneously
  - Ports are properly released after server shutdown, preventing lingering port occupation

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-19

### Changed
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for all external operations
  - **SessionStore errors**: Handle FILE_NOT_FOUND, PARSE_ERROR from session files (graceful degradation)
  - **ServiceKeyStore errors**: Handle FILE_NOT_FOUND, PARSE_ERROR, INVALID_CONFIG from service key files (log and fallback)
  - **TokenProvider errors**: Handle network errors (ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT, ENOTFOUND), validation errors, browser auth failures
  - **Write operation errors**: Handle failures when saving tokens/config to session files
  - All errors logged with detailed context (file paths, error codes, missing fields)
  - Broker continues with fallback mechanisms when possible instead of crashing
- **Token Refresh Architecture**: Removed direct UAA HTTP requests from AuthBroker
  - `getToken()` now uses provider's `refreshTokenFromSession()` (Step 2a) and `refreshTokenFromServiceKey()` (Step 2b) methods
  - All authentication logic delegated to providers (XsuaaTokenProvider, BtpTokenProvider)
  - Providers handle browser-based authentication and client_credentials flow internally
  - Better error handling with typed errors from `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers@0.2.0`
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in token requests
  - Network errors (connection issues) are now handled separately from HTTP errors (401, 403)
  - Better error messages with UAA URL context when network errors occur
  - No retry attempts for network errors (retries cannot fix infrastructure issues)

### Fixed
- **Defensive Programming**: Treat all injected dependencies as untrusted
  - File operations (session/service key stores) may fail - files missing, corrupted, permission issues
  - Network operations (token provider) may fail - timeouts, connection refused, invalid responses
  - All external operations wrapped in try-catch with specific error handling per operation type
  - Prevents broker crashes when consumers misconfigure files or network issues occur
- **Network Error Detection**: Add proper network error detection in token requests
  - Detect network errors: `ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`, `ENETUNREACH`, `EHOSTUNREACH`
  - Throw network errors immediately with clear error message indicating connectivity issues
  - Prevents confusing error messages when VPN is down or server is unreachable
  - Network errors now clearly indicate infrastructure issues vs authentication failures
- **Simplified Refresh**: `refreshToken()` now simply delegates to `getToken()` for full refresh flow
  - Ensures consistent refresh behavior across all token operations
  - No code duplication between getToken and refreshToken methods

### Removed
- **Direct UAA Code**: Removed direct UAA request methods and old credential flow
  - Removed `getTokenWithClientCredentials()` private method (logic moved to providers)
  - Removed `refreshTokenDirect()` private method (logic moved to providers)
  - Removed `allowClientCredentials` constructor parameter (handled by providers)
  - Removed old "Step 2: UAA Credentials Flow" (replaced with provider-based Step 2a/2b)

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.2.3` for STORE_ERROR_CODES and TOKEN_PROVIDER_ERROR_CODES
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores` to `^0.2.5` for typed errors (ParseError, FileNotFoundError, etc.)
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers` to `^0.2.0` for new refresh methods and typed errors

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- `allowClientCredentials` config flag (default: true). Set to `false` to skip UAA client_credentials flow and force provider/browser-based login (useful for ABAP ADT backends that reject service tokens).

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-13

### Changed
- Dependency bump: `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.1.16` to align with latest interfaces release

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed
- **ServiceUrl fallback from serviceKeyStore**: Fixed `getToken()` method to retrieve `serviceUrl` from `serviceKeyStore` when it's missing in session
  - Previously, `getToken()` would throw an error immediately if `serviceUrl` was not found in session, even when it was available in `serviceKeyStore`
  - Now, the method first checks session for `serviceUrl`, and if not found, attempts to retrieve it from `serviceKeyStore` before throwing an error
  - This allows integration tests and real-world scenarios to work correctly when session is empty but service key contains `serviceUrl`
  - Error messages now indicate that `serviceUrl` can come from either session or `serviceKeyStore`

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-08

### Breaking Changes

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a breaking change with NO backward compatibility. Migration is required. See Migration Guide below.**

#### Constructor Signature Changed
- **Constructor now accepts configuration object**: The constructor signature has changed from requiring all three dependencies to making `serviceKeyStore` and `tokenProvider` optional
- **No backward compatibility**: Old constructor signature is NOT supported. You must update your code to use the new signature. Migration guide provided below.
  - **Before (v0.1.x)**:
    ```typescript
    new AuthBroker({
      serviceKeyStore: serviceKeyStore,  // required
      sessionStore: sessionStore,         // required
      tokenProvider: tokenProvider,      // required
    }, browser?, logger?)
    ```
  - **After (v0.2.0)**:
    ```typescript
    new AuthBroker({
      sessionStore: sessionStore,         // required
      serviceKeyStore?: serviceKeyStore,  // optional
      tokenProvider?: tokenProvider,      // optional
    }, browser?, logger?)
    ```

#### New Authentication Flow
- **Three-step authentication flow**: `getToken()` now implements a new three-step flow (Step 0, Step 1, Step 2) instead of the previous six-step fallback chain
- **Direct UAA HTTP requests**: When UAA credentials are available in session, broker uses direct HTTP requests to UAA without requiring `tokenProvider`
- **Session initialization requirements**: SessionStore must contain initial session with `serviceUrl` before calling `getToken()`

### Added

#### Direct UAA HTTP Requests
- **Direct UAA refresh_token grant**: When UAA credentials are available in session, broker can refresh tokens directly via HTTP without `tokenProvider`
- **Direct UAA client_credentials grant**: When UAA credentials are available, broker can obtain tokens directly via HTTP without `tokenProvider`
- **Automatic fallback to provider**: If direct UAA requests fail and `tokenProvider` is available, broker automatically falls back to provider

#### Flexible Configuration
- **Optional serviceKeyStore**: `serviceKeyStore` is now optional - only needed for initializing sessions from service keys
- **Optional tokenProvider**: `tokenProvider` is now optional - only needed for browser authentication or when direct UAA requests fail
- **Session-only mode**: Can work with only `sessionStore` if session contains valid UAA credentials (no `serviceKeyStore` or `tokenProvider` needed)

#### Enhanced Error Messages
- **Step-based error messages**: Error messages now indicate which step failed (Step 0, Step 1, or Step 2)
- **Context-aware errors**: Error messages include information about what was tried and what's available
- **Actionable errors**: Error messages suggest what to do next (e.g., "Provide serviceKeyStore to initialize from service key")

### Changed

#### Authentication Flow (getToken)
- **Step 0: Session Initialization**: 
  - Checks if session has `authorizationToken` and UAA credentials
  - If both empty and `serviceKeyStore` available: tries direct UAA request from service key, falls back to provider if failed
  - If session has token OR UAA credentials → proceeds to Step 1
- **Step 1: Refresh Token Flow**:
  - If refresh token exists: tries direct UAA refresh, falls back to provider if failed
  - If successful → returns new token
  - Otherwise → proceeds to Step 2
- **Step 2: UAA Credentials Flow**:
  - Tries direct UAA client_credentials request, falls back to provider if failed
  - If successful → returns new token
  - If all failed → throws error

#### Token Refresh (refreshToken)
- **Direct UAA support**: Uses direct UAA HTTP requests when UAA credentials are available
- **Provider fallback**: Falls back to provider if direct UAA fails and provider is available

#### Dependencies
- **Added axios**: Added `axios@^1.13.2` as dependency for direct UAA HTTP requests
- **Updated interfaces**: Works with `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces@^0.1.4+`

### Migration Guide

#### Updating Constructor Calls

**Before (v0.1.x)**:
```typescript
const broker = new AuthBroker({
  serviceKeyStore: new AbapServiceKeyStore(['/path/to/destinations']),
  sessionStore: new AbapSessionStore(['/path/to/destinations']),
  tokenProvider: new BtpTokenProvider(),
}, 'chrome', logger);
```

**After (v0.2.0) - All dependencies**:
```typescript
const broker = new AuthBroker({
  sessionStore: new AbapSessionStore(['/path/to/destinations']),
  serviceKeyStore: new AbapServiceKeyStore(['/path/to/destinations']), // optional
  tokenProvider: new BtpTokenProvider(), // optional
}, 'chrome', logger);
```

**After (v0.2.0) - Session only (if session has UAA credentials)**:
```typescript
const broker = new AuthBroker({
  sessionStore: new AbapSessionStore(['/path/to/destinations']),
  // serviceKeyStore and tokenProvider not needed if session has UAA credentials
});
```

**After (v0.2.0) - Session + Service Key (for initialization)**:
```typescript
const broker = new AuthBroker({
  sessionStore: new AbapSessionStore(['/path/to/destinations']),
  serviceKeyStore: new AbapServiceKeyStore(['/path/to/destinations']),
  // tokenProvider optional - direct UAA requests will be used
});
```

#### Session Requirements

**Important**: SessionStore must contain initial session with `serviceUrl` before calling `getToken()`. If session is empty, provide `serviceKeyStore` to initialize from service key.

#### When to Provide tokenProvider

- **Required**: When initializing session from service key via browser authentication (Step 0)
- **Optional but recommended**: As fallback when direct UAA requests fail
- **Not needed**: When session contains valid UAA credentials (direct UAA requests will be used)

### Dependencies
- Updated to work with `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` v0.2.0+ (which removed token refresh and session storage)
- Updated to work with `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` v0.1.4+ (which removed session state methods from `IAbapConnection`)
- Added `axios@^1.13.2` for direct UAA HTTP requests

## [0.1.12] - 2025-12-09

### Added
- **Debugging Environment Variables**: Added comprehensive debugging support via environment variables
  - `DEBUG_AUTH_BROKER` - Enable/disable logging for auth-broker package (default: `false`)
  - `LOG_LEVEL` - Control log verbosity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` (default: `info`)
  - `DEBUG` - Alternative way to enable debugging (set to `true` or string containing `auth-broker`)
  - Logging is disabled by default to avoid misleading output in tests
  - Tests that expect errors use no-op logger to prevent error message output

### Changed
- **Test Logger Behavior**: Modified `createTestLogger` to require explicit enable via environment variables
  - No longer enabled by default in test environment (`NODE_ENV === 'test'`)
  - Requires `DEBUG_AUTH_BROKER=true` or `DEBUG=true` to enable logging
  - Prevents misleading error output in tests that expect errors
  - Tests that expect errors now use `noOpLogger` to avoid false error messages

### Fixed
- **Service URL Handling**: Fixed `serviceUrl` propagation for ABAP sessions
  - `AuthBroker` now retrieves `serviceUrl` from `serviceKeyStore` if not provided by `tokenProvider`
  - Ensures ABAP session stores receive required `serviceUrl` even when token provider doesn't return it
  - Applied to all authentication flows (refresh token, UAA, browser auth)

## [0.1.11] - 2025-12-07

### Changed

  - Validates that `stores` parameter is not null/undefined
  - Validates that `serviceKeyStore` is provided
  - Validates that `sessionStore` is provided
  - Validates that `tokenProvider` is provided
  - Throws descriptive error messages if any required dependency is missing
  - Helps catch configuration errors early during development

## [0.1.9] - 2025-12-05

### Changed
- **Dependency Injection for Logger**: Migrated from concrete `Logger` implementation to `ILogger` interface
  - Removed dependency on `@mcp-abap-adt/logger` package
  - Now uses `ILogger` interface from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces`
  - Logger parameter in constructor is optional - uses no-op logger if not provided
  - Follows Dependency Inversion Principle - depends on interface, not implementation
- **Bin Script Fixes**: Fixed `generate-env-from-service-key.ts` script
  - Corrected imports from non-existent packages (`@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores-btp`, `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores-xsuaa`) to correct package (`@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores`)
  - Fixed constructor parameters: changed from array `[directory]` to string `directory` for all store constructors

### Removed
- **Unused Dependencies**: Removed `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` dependency (not used in production code)

## [0.1.8] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Interfaces Package Integration**: Migrated to use `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` package for all interface definitions
  - All interfaces now imported from shared package
  - Backward compatibility maintained with type aliases
  - Dependency on `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces@^0.1.0` added
  - Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` dependency to `^0.1.14`

### Changed
- **Interface Renaming**: Interfaces renamed to follow `I` prefix convention:

  - `TokenProviderOptions` → `ITokenProviderOptions` (type alias for backward compatibility)
  - Old names still work via type aliases for backward compatibility
- **AuthType Export**: `AuthType` now exported from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` instead of local definition

## [0.1.7] - 2025-12-04

### Changed
- **getToken() Fallback Chain** - Improved authentication reliability with multi-step fallback chain
  - **Step 1**: Check if session exists and token is valid (returns immediately if valid)
  - **Step 2**: Verify service key exists (throws error if missing)
  - **Step 3**: Try refresh token authentication (via tokenProvider) if refresh token is available
  - **Step 4**: Try UAA client_credentials authentication (via tokenProvider) if refresh token missing or failed
  - **Step 5**: Try browser authentication (via tokenProvider) if UAA failed or parameters missing
  - **Step 6**: Throw comprehensive error if all methods failed
  - All authentication attempts use `ITokenProvider` interface (no direct implementation imports)
  - Token validation is performed only when checking existing session (step 1)
  - Tokens obtained through refresh/UAA/browser authentication are not validated before being saved
  - Improved error messages with details about which authentication methods failed

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-01

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` to `^0.1.13`:
  - **CSRF Token Endpoint Optimization**: Connection layer now uses `/sap/bc/adt/core/discovery` endpoint instead of `/sap/bc/adt/discovery`
    - Lighter response payload (smaller XML response)
    - Available on all SAP systems (on-premise and cloud)
    - Standard ADT discovery endpoint ensures better compatibility
  - **CSRF Configuration Export**: `CSRF_CONFIG` and `CSRF_ERROR_MESSAGES` constants are now exported from connection package
    - Enables consistent CSRF token handling across different connection implementations
    - Provides centralized configuration for retry logic, delays, and error messages
    - See [PR Proposal](https://github.com/fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/blob/main/packages/connection/PR_PROPOSAL_CSRF_CONFIG.md) for details

  - Backward compatible: `DEBUG_AUTH_LOG=true` still works (sets level to debug)
  - New `warn()` method in Logger interface for warning messages

### Fixed
- **Error Handling for Consumer** - Improved error handling to ensure consumer can distinguish different error types
  - Service key missing error: throws `Error` with message containing "No authentication found" or "Service key file not found"
  - Browser opening failed error: throws `Error` with message containing "Browser opening failed"
  - Both errors are now properly thrown and can be caught by consumer in `catch` blocks
  - Errors are distinct and can be programmatically handled differently

### Changed
- **Logger Implementation** - Enhanced logger with log level filtering
  - All log methods now respect the configured log level
