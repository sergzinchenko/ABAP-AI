## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **A callback server could hold its port after the login it was opened for had ended.** Three flows, three shapes of one defect: `browserAuth` leaked the socket when a callback carried neither `code` nor `error` — measured still bound at +5 s, +20 s, +35 s and +45 s, i.e. for the life of the process — while `oidcBrowserAuth` and `saml2Auth` had no timeout at all, so an abandoned login never settled and never released anything. (#11)
- **A rejected login could report a port that was not yet free.** Five exit paths closed the socket asynchronously *after* the promise had settled, leaving a window in which "already in use" was untrue.
- **`AuthorizationCodeProvider` raced `startBrowserAuth` against a second 30-second timer** of its own, so which fired was down to scheduling; when the outer one won it rejected while the socket was still bound. That timer was never cleared, keeping a login that succeeded in a second armed for the remaining 29.
- **A hung browser launcher could delay the timeout and the release.** The launch is no longer awaited on the critical path.

### Changed
- All three flows now run inside a factory scope implementing `CallbackServerFactory` from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces`. The port is released when the scope ends — by success, error, timeout, cancellation, or a body that throws — instead of when a promise happens to settle, and the scope settles only once the socket is free. `timeoutMs` is mandatory and an `AbortSignal` is honoured before, during and after the bind.
- Shutdown is bounded: stop accepting, wait up to 500 ms for `close`, then force. A timeout can no longer hang on its own cleanup.
- Requires `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` `^11.4.0` (was `^2.3.0`).
- **`engines.node` is now `>=18.2.0`** (was `>=18.0.0`), for `server.closeAllConnections()`.
- `browserAuth.ts` is 395 lines, down from 790: the HTTP server, six separate close sites, two timers and the process-signal handlers are gone from it.

### Removed
- **The callback server no longer installs `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` / `SIGHUP` / `exit` handlers.** A terminating process releases its listening sockets to the OS regardless — measured at 0-1 ms after the process disappears — and these were part of the cleanup tangle being removed. A client that kills the process mid-login still gets its port back.
- **The manual paste channel no longer retries a bad code.** It used to re-render the form when the exchange failed; the code is now exchanged after the scope closes, so a wrong or expired paste ends the attempt. That retry loop was the only reason the socket outlived the code.

### Notes
- Public API is unchanged: `AuthorizationCodeProviderConfig` keeps `browser` and `redirectPort`, still defaulting to 3001.
- The three factories stay internal. Exposing them so a consumer can supply its own callback receiver is issue #11 and is not part of this release.
- A callback carrying neither `code` nor `error` still ends the login with an error. Only the leaked socket was fixed, not the termination.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- `extractCode(input)` helper: pulls an OAuth2 authorization code out of a bare
  code, a `code=...` string, or a full redirected URL.
- Manual paste authentication for `none`/`headless` browser modes, so login can
  complete when the automatic `localhost` callback can't reach the process
  (browser on another machine / container / SSH). Three racing channels, first
  one wins:
  - the existing automatic `GET /callback?code=...` redirect;
  - an HTML paste form on the same callback server (`GET /` + `GET /submit`);
  - stdin paste, only when `process.stdin.isTTY` (never consumed under stdio
    RPC transports).

### Fixed
- `none`/`headless` mode now prints the authorization URL even when no logger is
  supplied. The prompt previously rode on `log?.info(...)` and was silently
  dropped without a logger; it now falls back to `stderr` (never stdout, to keep
  stdio RPC transports uncorrupted).

## [0.2.8] - 2025-12-24

### Changed
- **Integration Tests**: Replaced mock-based unit tests with comprehensive integration tests using real YAML configuration
  - Tests now use `test-config.yaml` for loading real service keys and session files
  - Simplified test configuration structure: only `destination` and optional `destination_dir` (removed `abap`/`xsuaa` sections)
  - Default paths: `~/.config/mcp-abap-adt` (Unix) or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\mcp-abap-adt` (Windows)
- **Logging**: Migrated from `console.log` to structured logging using `@mcp-abap-adt/logger`
  - All providers and browser auth functions now use `ILogger` interface
  - Consistent structured logging with log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - Better debugging with token validation details and execution flow

### Added
- **Test Scenarios**: Comprehensive integration test coverage for token lifecycle
  - Scenario 1 & 2: Token lifecycle - login via browser and reuse token from previous scenario
  - Scenario 3: Expired session + expired refresh token - provider should re-authenticate via browser
  - Token validation: Explicit validation of token expiration in all scenarios
- **Test Configuration**: Simplified `test-config.yaml.template` with detailed comments
  - Only requires `destination` name (service key and session files are auto-resolved)
  - Optional `destination_dir` (commented out by default, can be uncommented for custom paths)
  - Clear documentation of test scenarios and file formats

### Fixed
- **Test Hanging Issues**: Fixed tests hanging due to browser and port conflicts
  - Changed `browser: 'none'` to `browser: 'system'` for interactive authentication
  - Each test scenario uses unique ports (3101, 3102, 3103) to avoid conflicts
  - Improved server cleanup: `resolve(tokens)` called immediately after token exchange, server closes asynchronously
  - Added delays after browser-based tests to allow ports to free up
- **Token Validation**: Added explicit token validation in all test scenarios
  - Tests verify that returned tokens are valid and not expired
  - Uses JWT `exp` claim validation with 60-second buffer (matching `BaseTokenProvider`)

## [0.2.7] - 2025-12-24

### Changed

  - Added `@biomejs/biome` as dev dependency (^2.3.10)
  - Added `biome.json` configuration file with recommended rules
  - Added npm scripts: `lint`, `lint:check`, `format`
  - Updated `build` script to include Biome check before TypeScript compilation
  - All code now follows Biome formatting and linting rules

### Fixed

  - All catch blocks: Changed from `any` to `unknown` with proper type guards
  - Promise resolve/reject handlers: Added proper types instead of `any`
  - Error handling: Improved error message extraction with proper type checking
  - `RefreshError` constructor: Fixed type compatibility when passing error causes
- **Code Quality**: Improved code style
  - Replaced optional chaining where appropriate
  - Fixed assignment in expression (moved to separate statement)
  - Added Biome override for test files to allow non-null assertions in tests

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-21

### Changed
- **Local JWT Validation**: Both `BtpTokenProvider.validateToken()` and `XsuaaTokenProvider.validateToken()` now validate JWT locally by checking `exp` claim instead of making HTTP requests
  - No HTTP calls to SAP server for validation
  - Prevents unnecessary browser authentication when server is unreachable (ECONNREFUSED, timeout)
  - 60-second buffer before expiration to account for clock skew
  - HTTP validation (401/403) is handled by retry mechanism in `makeAdtRequest` wrapper
  - Consistent validation behavior across all token providers

### Fixed
- **Browser Auth on Network Error**: Fixed issue where network errors during token validation would trigger browser authentication
  - Previously, network errors could return `false` → triggered refresh → opened browser
  - Now, validation is purely local - network issues are handled at request time

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Headless Browser Mode**: Added `browser: 'headless'` option for SSH and remote sessions
  - Logs authentication URL and waits for manual callback
  - Server keeps running until user completes authentication in their browser
  - Ideal for environments without display (SSH, Docker, CI/CD)
  - Differs from `'none'` which immediately rejects (for automated tests)
- **Cross-Platform Browser Support**: Improved browser opening reliability across all platforms
  - **Linux**: Added `DISPLAY=:0` fallback when `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` environment variables are not set
    - Helps when running from terminals that don't set DISPLAY automatically
    - Logs when fallback is used for debugging
  - **Linux**: Added alternative browser executable names for better compatibility
    - Chrome: `google-chrome`, `google-chrome-stable`, `chromium`, `chromium-browser`
    - Edge: `microsoft-edge`, `microsoft-edge-stable`
    - Firefox: `firefox`, `firefox-esr`
  - **Windows**: Added `SIGBREAK` signal handler for cleanup (Ctrl+Break)
    - Ensures proper port cleanup on Windows-specific termination signals

### Fixed
- **Windows Browser Opening**: Fixed fallback browser commands for Windows
  - Changed from `start chrome` to `cmd /c start "" "chrome"` syntax
  - Fixed system default browser opening with proper empty title parameter
  - Prevents "command not found" errors when using fallback mechanism

### Changed
- **Dependency Update**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.2.4` for headless browser mode support
- **Test Coverage**: Added unit tests for browser modes (`none` and `headless`)
  - Tests verify `none` mode rejects immediately with URL in error message
  - Tests verify `headless` mode logs URL and waits for callback

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- **Process Termination Cleanup**: OAuth callback server now properly cleans up when process is terminated
  - Added `process.on('exit', 'SIGTERM', 'SIGINT', 'SIGHUP')` handlers to ensure server closes on process termination
  - This fixes port leaks when MCP clients (like Cline) kill the stdio server before authentication completes
  - Cleanup handlers are automatically removed after authentication completes to prevent memory leaks
  - Ports are now properly freed even when process is forcefully terminated

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Automatic Port Selection**: Browser auth server now automatically finds an available port if the requested port is in use
  - When `startBrowserAuth()` is called with a port, it checks if the port is available
  - If the port is busy, it automatically tries the next ports (up to 10 attempts)
  - This prevents `EADDRINUSE` errors when multiple stdio servers run simultaneously
  - Port selection happens before server startup, ensuring no conflicts

### Fixed
- **Server Port Cleanup**: Improved server shutdown to ensure ports are properly freed after authentication completes
  - Added `keepAliveTimeout = 0` and `headersTimeout = 0` to prevent connections from staying open
  - Added `closeAllConnections()` calls before `server.close()` to ensure all connections are closed
  - Server now waits for HTTP response to finish before closing to prevent connection leaks
  - Added proper error handling for browser open failures to ensure server is closed
  - Server now properly closes in all error scenarios (timeout, browser open failure, callback errors)
  - This prevents ports from remaining occupied after authentication completes or server shutdown

### Changed
- **Port Selection Logic**: `startBrowserAuth()` now uses `findAvailablePort()` to automatically select a free port
  - Default behavior: tries requested port first, then tries next ports if busy
  - Port range: tries up to 10 consecutive ports starting from the requested port
  - Logs when a different port is used (for debugging)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Typed Error Classes**: Added specialized error classes for better error handling and debugging
  - `TokenProviderError` - Base class for all token provider errors with error code
  - `ValidationError` - Thrown when authConfig validation fails (includes `missingFields: string[]` array)
  - `RefreshError` - Thrown when token refresh operation fails (includes `cause?: Error` with original error)
  - `SessionDataError` - Thrown when session data is invalid or incomplete (includes `missingFields` array)
  - `ServiceKeyError` - Thrown when service key data is invalid or incomplete (includes `missingFields` array)
  - `BrowserAuthError` - Thrown when browser authentication fails or is cancelled (includes `cause` error)
  - All error codes use constants from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` package (`TOKEN_PROVIDER_ERROR_CODES`)
  - Errors are exported from package root for easy import

### Changed
- **Enhanced Validation Error Messages**: Validation errors now list specific missing field names instead of generic messages
  - Example: `XSUAA refreshTokenFromSession: authConfig missing required fields: uaaUrl, uaaClientId`
  - `ValidationError` includes `missingFields: string[]` property for programmatic access to missing fields
  - Each missing field is checked individually and added to the list
- **Improved Error Handling in Refresh Methods**: All refresh operations now wrap errors with typed error classes
  - `refreshTokenFromSession` throws `RefreshError` when client_credentials or browser auth fails
  - `refreshTokenFromServiceKey` throws `RefreshError` when browser authentication fails
  - Original error is preserved in `RefreshError.cause` property for debugging
  - Error messages include provider type (XSUAA/BTP) and operation name for clarity
- **Dependency Update**: Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.2.2` for `TOKEN_PROVIDER_ERROR_CODES` constants
- **Test Coverage**: Added tests for error handling edge cases
  - Tests verify `RefreshError` is thrown when authentication fails
  - Tests verify `ValidationError` includes correct missing field names
  - Tests verify error messages contain expected substrings

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-13

### Changed
- Dependency bump: `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` to `^0.1.16` to align with latest interfaces release

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-08

### Added
- **Integration Tests for browserAuth**: Added real integration test that uses actual service keys and OAuth flow
  - Test verifies token retrieval with real credentials from service keys
  - Shows all authentication stages with logging when `DEBUG_AUTH_PROVIDERS=true` is set
  - Tests both access token and refresh token retrieval
- **Test Logger Helper**: Added `createTestLogger` helper for tests with environment variable control
  - Supports log levels (debug, info, warn, error) via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
  - Only outputs logs when `DEBUG_AUTH_PROVIDERS=true` or `DEBUG_BROWSER_AUTH=true` is set
  - Provides clean, controlled logging for test scenarios

### Changed
- **Improved Logging in browserAuth**: Made logging more concise and informative
  - All log messages are now single-line strings without verbose objects
  - Logs show key information: what we send, what we receive, token lengths
  - Example: `Tokens received: accessToken(2263 chars), refreshToken(34 chars)`
  - Logging only works when logger is provided (no default console output)
- **exchangeCodeForToken Function**: Exported for testing purposes
  - Function is marked as `@internal` but exported to enable unit testing
  - Allows testing token exchange logic without full browser auth flow

### Fixed
- **Test Error Logging**: Fixed error test to use mock logger without console output
  - Error test no longer pollutes console with error messages
  - Still verifies that error logging occurs via spy

## [0.1.3] - 2025-12-07

### Added
- **Configurable Browser Auth Port**: Added optional `browserAuthPort` parameter to `BtpTokenProvider` constructor
  - Allows configuring the OAuth callback server port (default: 3001)
  - Prevents port conflicts when proxy server runs on the same port
  - Port is passed through to `startBrowserAuth` and `exchangeCodeForToken` functions
  - Enables proxy to configure browser auth port via CLI parameter or YAML config

### Changed
- **BtpTokenProvider Constructor**: Now accepts optional `browserAuthPort?: number` parameter
  - Defaults to 3001 if not specified (maintains backward compatibility)
- **startBrowserAuth Function**: Added optional `port: number = 3001` parameter
  - Port is used for OAuth callback server and redirect URI
- **exchangeCodeForToken Function**: Added optional `port: number = 3001` parameter
  - Port is used in redirect URI when exchanging authorization code for tokens
- **Implementation Isolation**: Internal authentication functions are no longer exported from package
  - `startBrowserAuth`, `refreshJwtToken`, and `getTokenWithClientCredentials` are now internal functions
  - Providers use private method wrappers to call these functions
  - Constructor parameters (like `browserAuthPort`) are passed through private methods to internal functions
  - This ensures proper encapsulation and prevents direct usage of internal implementation details
- **Test Improvements**: Unit tests now use provider methods instead of direct internal function imports
  - Tests use `jest.spyOn` to mock private provider methods instead of mocking internal functions
  - Tests now properly test the public API of providers, ensuring better isolation
  - This aligns with encapsulation principles and makes tests more maintainable

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-05

### Changed
- **Dependency Injection**: Moved `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores` and `@mcp-abap-adt/logger` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`
  - These packages are only used in tests, not in production code
  - Logger is injected via `ITokenProviderOptions.logger?: ILogger` interface in production code
  - Auth stores are not used in production code (consumers inject their own store implementations)

### Removed
- **Unused Dependencies**: Removed `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` dependency (not used in production code)

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Interfaces Package Integration**: Migrated to use `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` package for all interface definitions
  - All interfaces now imported from shared package
  - Dependency on `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces@^0.1.1` added
  - Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` dependency to `^0.1.14`
  - Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores` dependency to `^0.1.3`

### Changed
- **Interface Renaming**: Interfaces renamed to follow `I` prefix convention:
  - `TokenProviderResult` → `ITokenProviderResult` (type alias for backward compatibility)
  - `TokenProviderOptions` → `ITokenProviderOptions` (type alias for backward compatibility)
  - Old names still work via type aliases for backward compatibility
- **Logger Interface**: Updated to use `ILogger` from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` instead of `Logger` from `@mcp-abap-adt/logger`
  - `browserAuth.ts` now uses `ILogger` interface with basic methods (info, error, warn, debug)
  - Browser-specific logging methods (browserUrl, browserOpening) now use basic `info` and `debug` methods

### Fixed
- **BtpTokenProvider Integration Tests**: Fixed to use ABAP destination and `AbapServiceKeyStore` instead of XSUAA
  - BTP and ABAP use the same authentication flow and service key format
  - Tests now correctly use `getAbapDestination` and `hasRealConfig(config, 'abap')`
  - Tests now use `AbapServiceKeyStore` instead of `BtpServiceKeyStore` for loading service keys

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-04

### Added

  - Tests for token validation
  - BTP tests use `AbapServiceKeyStore` (same format as ABAP) and `BtpSessionStore` (without `sapUrl`)
  - ABAP tests use `AbapServiceKeyStore` and `AbapSessionStore` (with `sapUrl`)
  - Both BTP and ABAP tests use `abap.destination` from config (same authentication flow)

### Fixed
- **Integration Tests**: Corrected BTP and ABAP test separation
  - BTP tests correctly handle base BTP sessions (no `sapUrl` required)
  - ABAP tests correctly handle ABAP sessions (with `sapUrl` from service key)
- **Token Validation**: BTP tests now handle cases where `serviceUrl` may not be available (base BTP)
- **Session Storage**: BTP tests no longer attempt to save `serviceUrl` to `BtpSessionStore` (which doesn't accept `sapUrl`)

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated README to clarify BTP vs ABAP differences and correct store usage
  - Added explicit examples showing BTP and ABAP as separate entities
  - Clarified that BTP uses `BtpServiceKeyStore`/`BtpSessionStore` (without `sapUrl`)
