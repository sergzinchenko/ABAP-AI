# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [11.6.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- `IAuthorizationStrategy<TResult>`, `AuthorizationRequest` and
  `AuthorizationOutcome<TResult>` — the contract by which a consumer supplies
  its own way of conducting an interactive authorization.
- `ICallbackServerOptions.logger` — where the transport reports an ignored
  request.

### Changed

- `ICallbackServerOptions.port` accepts `0`, meaning an ephemeral port. Flows
  that build their authorization URL before binding still cannot use it.

## [11.5.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Connection capability atoms — `ISessionLifecycleAware` and `ILockWindowAware`**, with
  `ITeardownReport`, `WindowToken`, `ADT_SESSION_ERROR` and `AdtSessionErrorCode`.

  `ISessionLifecycleAware` describes a connection whose session is owned and observable:
  `disconnect()` resolving with a report of what it could not finish, `isConnected()`, and
  `getSessionIdentity()` naming which **server session** the connection is on. That last one
  is the point — a stable client-side conversation id says nothing about whether the server
  replaced the session underneath it, and a caller holding a lock had no way to notice.

  `ILockWindowAware` marks a span that must not lose its session, such as LOCK to UNLOCK. A
  lock outlives the request that takes it, so a teardown in that span strands the lock rather
  than merely failing a request; a teardown waits for an open window, bounded, and reports it
  as abandoned instead of dropping it silently. `WindowToken` is a symbol rather than a string
  because the same object may be locked twice in one chain and the two must close independently.

  **Additive, following the ADT capability atoms.** `IAbapConnection` is unchanged: it stays
  the minimum every transport can honour, and these are the things only some can. An RFC
  connection, a batch recorder and a test stub are all legitimate `IAbapConnection`s that own
  no HTTP session and can open no lock window — making these methods mandatory would force
  each of them to implement a lie. An implementation adds an atom when it genuinely supports
  it; a consumer narrows to the atom it needs. Pinned by `src/__typechecks__/connectionCapabilities.ts`,
  which asserts a session-less connection still satisfies `IAbapConnection`.

## [11.4.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Callback server contract** — `ICallbackServerOptions`, `ICallbackServerHandle<TResult>`
  and `CallbackServerFactory<TResult>`, describing the lifetime of the local listener that
  receives an interactive login's redirect.

  The handle is borrowed inside a factory callback, and the port is released on the first
  terminal outcome: the callback returning or throwing, an explicit `fail`, the timeout, or
  an abort. Releasing the socket is therefore never a consequence of a wait settling — which
  is the shape that lets an abandoned login hold a port for the lifetime of a process.

  `timeoutMs` is mandatory, bounded by Node's 32-bit `setTimeout` delay so that a
  generous-looking value cannot silently become 1 ms, and cancellation is available through
  an `AbortSignal`. The contract is domain-agnostic: an OAuth authorization code, OIDC
  `code` + `state` and a SAML `SAMLResponse` all fit through it, parameterised by result.

## [11.3.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Named capability composites** `IAdtSourceObject` (full capability set) and
  `IAdtNonVersionedObject` (all but version history), for handlers to declare
  their honest capability profile instead of the fat contract.

### Deprecated
- **`IAdtObject`.** It remains as the full-capability composite (structurally
  identical to `IAdtSourceObject`, asserted at compile time) for backward
  compatibility, and will be removed in a later major. New code should depend on
  the specific capability atoms or a composite.

## [11.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Capability atom interfaces.** Seven small interfaces — `IAdtCrud`,
  `IAdtValidatable`, `IAdtCheckable`, `IAdtActivatable`, `IAdtLockable`,
  `IAdtVersionable`, `IAdtTransportAware` — partition the 13 methods of
  `IAdtObject` so each method belongs to exactly one. Purely additive:
  `IAdtObject` is unchanged, and a compile-time proof asserts the intersection
  of the atoms is structurally identical to it. Consumers may depend on a
  narrow capability instead of the whole contract.

## [11.0.0] - 2026-07-19

Type-promotion consolidation: `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` becomes the single definition site for the object-type modules' consumer-facing types. adt-clients will import and re-export these (a follow-up adt-clients release); its public API is unchanged.

### Added
- **`IXxxConfig`/`IXxxState` for all object-type modules** (~29 pairs across 27 modules) — previously local-only in adt-clients, now defined here (verbatim).
- **Cross-cutting shared types** in the new `src/adt/IAdtShared.ts` — `AdtObjectType`(+`…Lower`/source variants), `IObjectReference`, `ISearchObjectsParams`/`ISearchResult`, `IGetSqlQueryParams`, `IGetTableContentsParams`, `IGetDiscoveryParams`, `IGetWhereUsed*Params`, `IWhereUsedReference`/`IWhereUsedListResult`, `IVirtualFolders*`, `IGetPackageHierarchyOptions`/`PackageHierarchy*`/`IPackageHierarchyNode`, `IGetPackageContentsListOptions`/`IPackageContentItem`, `IInactiveObjectsResponse`.
- **Missing/renamed params and option/result types** brought in to match adt-clients (e.g. `IMetadataExtensionCreateParams`/`ValidationParams`, `IFeatureToggleSource` + nested, service-binding operation params, `IClassUnitTest*`, `IFeatureToggleObject`).
- **Public helper/config types promoted so adt-clients can re-export its consumer-facing type surface from here:** behaviorDefinition `IValidationResult`/`ILockResult`/`CheckReporter`/`ICheckMessage`/`ICheckRunResult`, `IEnhancementMetadata`, CDS unit-test `ICdsUnitTestConfig`/`ICdsUnitTestState`, and class-includes `ILocalTestClassConfig`/`ILocalTypesConfig`/`ILocalDefinitionsConfig`/`ILocalMacrosConfig`. Deliberately NOT promoted (stay adt-clients-local): `IAdtClientOptions` (the client class's own constructor options), and the `AdtXxxType` convenience aliases (e.g. `AdtClassType = IAdtObject<IClassConfig, IClassState>`) which are composed locally from the promoted `Config`/`State` rather than being shared contract types themselves.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Param interfaces reconciled to adt-clients' actual shape (verbatim).** adt-clients is the source of truth (it runs against SAP); the interfaces copies had drifted. Reconciliation includes field-name changes where the two diverged — notably snake_case→camelCase for `masterSystem`/`masterLanguage` (interfaces previously used `master_system`), the `IFixedValue` nested shape (`{ low; high?; description? }` → `{ low; text }`), tightened optionality (e.g. `IUpdateDomainParams.package_name`), and `behaviorDefinition` param renames. A consumer compiling against the old field names/shapes must update.
- `IAdtService` replaced by the canonical `IAdtServiceBinding` shape (+ `IAdtService = IAdtServiceBinding` alias), restoring the previously-missing `deleteServiceBinding` member.

### Removed (BREAKING)
- **37 stale interfaces-only param types** that no consumer used (e.g. `IReadClassParams`, `IUpdateClassParams`, `IReadDomainParams`, the CRUD-named `ICreate/IRead/IUpdate/IDeleteMetadataExtensionParams`, `IRunUnitTestParams`, and other `IRead*`/`IUpdate*`/`IDelete*` leftovers). Each was verified to have zero references across adt-clients before removal.

`IReadOptions` (already at `src/shared/IReadOptions.ts`) is unchanged. `IUpdate*Params.source_code` (live) and all runtime/infrastructure types are untouched.

## [10.0.0] - 2026-07-17

### Removed (BREAKING)
- **`source_code` removed from create-params** — `ICreateAccessControlParams`, `ICreateServiceDefinitionParams`, `ICreateEnhancementParams`. The field was a no-op on create (deprecated in 9.2.1) and is now gone; source is written via the update flow (`IUpdate*Params.source_code`, untouched). This is a breaking type change: a consumer compiling against `ICreate*Params.source_code` under a `^9.x` range will no longer compile — hence the major bump. No runtime behavior changes (the field was never read on create). Completes the drift resolution with `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` 7.4.3.

## [9.2.1] - 2026-07-17

### Deprecated
- **`source_code` on create-params marked `@deprecated`** in `ICreateAccessControlParams`, `ICreateServiceDefinitionParams`, and `ICreateEnhancementParams`. The field is a no-op on create — create posts metadata only; source is written by the update flow (`IUpdate*Params.source_code`). This resolves the drift with `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` 7.4.3, which stopped populating it. The field is kept (not removed) to avoid a breaking change; hard removal is deferred to the planned type-consolidation pass. `IUpdate*Params.source_code` (live) is untouched.

## [9.2.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Message class (MSAG) param types** in `IAdtMessageClass.ts` — `ICreate/Read/Update/DeleteMessageClassParams` and the message equivalents (`ICreate/UpdateMessageClassMessageParams`, `IDeleteMessageClassMessageParams`). Low-level (snake_case) params for the upcoming adt-clients message-class CRUD clients. `IUpdateMessageClassMessageParams` keeps `msgtext` optional so an update may change only the description or self-explanatory flag. Additive; no changes to existing types.

## [9.1.1] - 2026-07-01

### Security
- **Bumped dev-only `axios` `^1.11.0` → `^1.18.1`** and added an `overrides` entry pinning `form-data` to `^4.0.6`, clearing all 25 Dependabot alerts (axios proxy-auth/prototype-pollution/SSRF/ReDoS advisories, `follow-redirects` `1.15.11`→`1.16.0` auth-header leak, `form-data` `4.0.5`→`4.0.6` CRLF injection). `axios` is only a devDependency here and is not shipped to consumers, so runtime exposure was negligible; no published API change.

## [9.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`IObjectVersion.transportRequest?` / `transportDescription?`** — optional fields exposing the transport request a version was recorded under (from the version feed's per-entry transport-request link, e.g. id `DS4K901917` + its short text). Additive; versions without a transport leave them undefined.

## [9.0.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added (BREAKING)
- **Object version history on `IAdtObject`.** New required methods `getVersions(config: Partial<TConfig>): Promise<IObjectVersion[]>` and `getVersionSource(contentUri: string): Promise<string>`, a new `IObjectVersion` type (`versionId`, `author?`, `updatedAt?`, `title?`, `contentUri`), and a new `AdtObjectErrorCodes.UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` (`'ADT_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION'`). Adding **required** methods to the exported `IAdtObject` interface is source-breaking for every implementer (all `AdtXxx` in `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`, plus any consumer/test mocks), so this is a major bump. Implementations live in `adt-clients` (each object type owns its own `/versions` endpoint; non-source types throw `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`).

## [8.0.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Renamed the dead `IAdtView` parameter interfaces to `IAdtDdl`.** `ICreateViewParams`/`IReadViewParams`/`IUpdateViewParams`/`IDeleteViewParams` → `ICreate/Read/Update/DeleteDdlParams`, the `view_name` field → `ddl_name`, and `src/adt/IAdtView.ts` → `src/adt/IAdtDdl.ts`. These describe the generic DDL-source endpoint (`/sap/bc/adt/ddic/ddl/sources/` — CDS views, AMDP table functions, …), aligning with the View→Ddl rename in `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` 6.0.0 and `@mcp-abap-adt/core` 8.0.0. The old exports were unused by current consumers (`@mcp-abap-adt/core` imports none of them; `adt-clients` defines its own local DDL param types). Major bump so `^7.x` consumers are not auto-upgraded onto the renamed exports.

## [7.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- `ICreatePackageParams.master_language?: string` — master/original language for created packages (e.g. `"EN"`, `"DE"`), defaults to EN when unset. Brings package create params in line with the configurable-master-language support of the other object types (fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt#105).

## [7.2.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Certificate (mTLS) and Kerberos auth types.** `SapAuthType` extended to `'basic' | 'jwt' | 'saml' | 'certificate' | 'kerberos'`.
- **`ISapConfig`** new optional fields: `certPath`, `certKeyPath`, `certPfxPath`, `certPassphrase` (certificate/mTLS) and `kerberosSpn`, `kerberosService` (Kerberos/SPNEGO).
- **`ICertificateMaterialLoader`** + **`ICertificateMaterial`** (`src/auth/ICertificateMaterialLoader.ts`) — contract for loading client-certificate material (PEM/PFX) for an `https.Agent`; exported from the package root.

### Notes

- Certificate and Kerberos are connection-layer auth types (on-prem HTTP); they bypass the auth-broker. `IConnectionConfig.authType` (the broker's surface) is intentionally left as `'basic' | 'jwt' | 'saml'`.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`ICalmConnection`** interface (`src/connection/ICalmConnection.ts`) — minimal contract for SAP Cloud ALM HTTP APIs: `connect()`, `getBaseUrl()`, `getServiceUrl(service)`, `makeRequest(options)`. Mirrors the `IAbapConnection` narrow-contract pattern so resource clients depend on one interface only.
- **`ICalmResponse<T, D>`** type alias — shares `IAdtResponse` shape for consistent payload semantics across ADT and Cloud ALM.
- **`ICalmRequestOptions`** interface (`src/connection/ICalmRequestOptions.ts`) — request options accepted by `ICalmConnection.makeRequest`.
- **`CalmService`** string-literal union + **`CALM_SERVICES`** frozen tuple (`src/connection/CalmService.ts`) — the 9 Cloud ALM services: `features`, `documents`, `tasks`, `projects`, `testManagement`, `hierarchy`, `analytics`, `processMonitoring`, `logs`.

### Notes

- Purely additive — no existing interfaces or types changed. Consumers on `^7.0.0` continue to work unchanged.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Breaking Changes

- **`ICreateServiceBindingParams`**: replaced `binding_type: ServiceBindingType`, `binding_version: ServiceBindingVersion`, `binding_category?: string` with single `binding_variant: ServiceBindingVariant` field

### Added

- **`ServiceBindingVariant`** type — 4 ODATA variants: `ODATA_V2_UI`, `ODATA_V2_WEB_API`, `ODATA_V4_UI`, `ODATA_V4_WEB_API`
- **`SERVICE_BINDING_VARIANT_MAP`** constant — maps each variant to `{ bindingType, bindingVersion, bindingCategory, serviceType }`

## [6.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`connect()`** method to `IAbapConnection` interface — initializes connection by fetching CSRF token and establishing session cookies. Must be called before making any ADT requests. All existing implementations (`BaseAbapConnection`, `JwtAbapConnection`, `SamlAbapConnection`, `RfcAbapConnection`) already have this method; this change formalizes it in the contract.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Breaking Changes

- **`IRuntimeAnalysisObject`** is now generic: `IRuntimeAnalysisObject<TKind extends string = string>`
  - The `kind` field type changes from `string` to `TKind`, enabling literal type narrowing
  - Default generic (`= string`) preserves backwards compatibility for unparameterized usage
  - Consumers who extend `IRuntimeAnalysisObject` without a type parameter are unaffected
  - Consumers who inspect `kind` at the type level may see narrower types
- **`IListableRuntimeObject`** now extends `IRuntimeAnalysisObject` and accepts a third generic parameter:
  `IListableRuntimeObject<TResult, TOptions, TKind extends string = string>`
  - Previously `IListableRuntimeObject` was independent; now all listable runtime objects expose a `kind` discriminator
  - Existing `IListableRuntimeObject<TResult, TOptions>` usage compiles unchanged (default `TKind = string`)

### Added — from issue #6

The following interfaces were requested in #6 to support `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` refactoring (branch `feature/feed-reader-extensions`), so factory methods return interfaces instead of concrete classes:

- **Debugger domain** (`runtime/IDebugger.ts`):
  - `IDebugger` — composite interface exposing `getAbap()`, `getAmdp()`, `getMemorySnapshots()`
  - `IAbapDebugger` — ABAP debugger with session management, breakpoints, variables, watchpoints, and batch operations (23 methods)
  - `IAmdpDebugger` — AMDP debugger with start/resume/terminate, variable inspection, breakpoints, data preview (14 methods)
  - Option types: `ILaunchDebuggerOptions`, `IStopDebuggerOptions`, `IGetDebuggerOptions`, `IGetSystemAreaOptions`, `IGetVariableAsCsvOptions`, `IGetVariableAsJsonOptions`, `IGetVariableValueStatementOptions`, `IStartAmdpDebuggerOptions`, `IGetAmdpDataPreviewOptions`, `IGetAmdpCellSubstringOptions`
  - Type alias: `IAbapDebuggerStepMethod` (`'stepInto' | 'stepOut' | 'stepContinue'`)
- **Memory snapshots** (`runtime/IMemorySnapshots.ts`):
  - `IMemorySnapshots` — list, getById, overview, ranking lists, children, references, and delta analysis (9 methods)
  - Option types: `IMemorySnapshotsListOptions`, `ISnapshotRankingListOptions`, `ISnapshotChildrenOptions`, `ISnapshotReferencesOptions`
- **Profiler** (`runtime/IProfiler.ts`):
  - `IProfiler` — trace parameter management, hit lists, statements, DB accesses, requests, object/process types (11 methods)
  - Option types: `IProfilerListOptions`, `IProfilerTraceParameters`, `IProfilerTraceHitListOptions`, `IProfilerTraceStatementsOptions`, `IProfilerTraceDbAccessesOptions`
- **Traces** (`runtime/ICrossTrace.ts`, `runtime/ISt05Trace.ts`):
  - `ICrossTrace` — cross-trace listing, records, activations (4 methods)
  - `ISt05Trace` — SQL trace state and directory (2 methods)
  - Option type: `IListCrossTracesOptions`
- **Logs** (`runtime/IApplicationLog.ts`, `runtime/IAtcLog.ts`):
  - `IApplicationLog` — application log object/source access and name validation (3 methods)
  - `IAtcLog` — ATC check failure logs and execution logs (2 methods)
  - Option types: `IGetApplicationLogObjectOptions`, `IGetApplicationLogSourceOptions`, `IGetCheckFailureLogsOptions`
- **DDIC** (`runtime/IDdicActivation.ts`):
  - `IDdicActivation` — activation graph access (1 method)
  - Option type: `IGetActivationGraphOptions`
- **Dumps** (`runtime/IRuntimeDumps.ts`):
  - `IRuntimeDumps` — dump listing by user, getById with view options (2 methods + inherited `list()`)
  - Option types: `IRuntimeDumpsListOptions`, `IRuntimeDumpReadOptions`
  - Type alias: `IRuntimeDumpReadView` (`'default' | 'summary' | 'formatted'`)
- **Feeds-based** (`runtime/ISystemMessages.ts`, `runtime/IGatewayErrorLog.ts`):
  - `ISystemMessages` — system message listing and getById (reuses `IFeedQueryOptions`)
  - `IGatewayErrorLog` — gateway error listing and getById by type+id (reuses `IFeedQueryOptions`)

### Added — design decisions beyond issue #6

The following were not in the original issue but emerged during design review:

- **Typed discriminator** (`IRuntimeAnalysisObject<TKind>`) — enables literal `kind` values per interface (e.g., `'profiler'`, `'debugger'`), supporting `switch`/`if` narrowing in consumer code. Discriminator values are contractual (changing them is a breaking change).
- **`IListableRuntimeObject` extends `IRuntimeAnalysisObject`** — all listable objects now expose `kind` consistently, eliminating the need for each interface to extend both base types separately.
- **`TKind` propagation** — `IListableRuntimeObject` passes `TKind` to `IRuntimeAnalysisObject`, so consumers get literal `kind` types from listable objects too.
- **Implementation helpers excluded** — methods like `buildBatchPayload()`, `buildParametersXml()`, `extractIdFromResponse()`, `getDefaultParameters()`, `buildIdPrefix()`, `buildUserQuery()` were in the issue but excluded from the public interface contract. These are implementation details that stay in `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`.

### Discriminator values (public contract)

| Interface | `kind` value |
|-----------|-------------|
| `IDebugger` | `'debugger'` |
| `IAbapDebugger` | `'abapDebugger'` |
| `IAmdpDebugger` | `'amdpDebugger'` |
| `IMemorySnapshots` | `'memorySnapshots'` |
| `IProfiler` | `'profiler'` |
| `ICrossTrace` | `'crossTrace'` |
| `ISt05Trace` | `'st05Trace'` |
| `IApplicationLog` | `'applicationLog'` |
| `IAtcLog` | `'atcLog'` |
| `IDdicActivation` | `'ddicActivation'` |
| `IRuntimeDumps` | `'runtimeDumps'` |
| `ISystemMessages` | `'systemMessages'` |
| `IGatewayErrorLog` | `'gatewayErrorLog'` |

### Consumer usage

**Importing runtime interfaces:**

```typescript
import type {
  IDebugger,
  IAbapDebugger,
  IProfiler,
  IRuntimeDumps,
  IProfilerTraceParameters,
} from '@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces';
```

**Using typed discriminators for narrowing:**

```typescript
import type { IRuntimeAnalysisObject } from '@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces';

function handleRuntimeObject(obj: IRuntimeAnalysisObject) {
  switch (obj.kind) {
    case 'profiler':
      // TypeScript knows obj has kind: 'profiler'
      break;
    case 'debugger':
      break;
  }
}
```

**Factory methods in `adt-clients` will return these interfaces:**

```typescript
// Before (adt-clients returns concrete class):
const profiler = client.getProfiler(); // returns ProfilerDomain

// After (adt-clients returns interface from this package):
const profiler: IProfiler = client.getProfiler(); // returns IProfiler
```

### Migration guide (5.1.0 → 6.0.0)

**Most consumers: no changes needed.** The default generic parameters (`= string`) ensure backwards compatibility.

**If you extend `IRuntimeAnalysisObject`:**

```typescript
// Before (5.1.0):
interface MyObject extends IRuntimeAnalysisObject { ... }

// After (6.0.0) — still works as-is, but you can now add a literal kind:
interface MyObject extends IRuntimeAnalysisObject<'myObject'> { ... }
```

**If you extend `IListableRuntimeObject`:**

```typescript
// Before (5.1.0):
interface MyList extends IListableRuntimeObject<IAdtResponse, MyOptions> { ... }

// After (6.0.0) — still works, but now MyList also has `kind: string`.
// To add a literal kind:
interface MyList extends IListableRuntimeObject<IAdtResponse, MyOptions, 'myList'> { ... }
```

**If you check `kind` at the type level:**
The `kind` field is now `readonly`. If you were assigning to it, you'll get a compile error. Use the constructor or factory to set it.

  - New `OAuth2GrantType` type and constants for OAuth2 grant types:
    - `AUTH_TYPE_AUTHORIZATION_CODE` - Standard authorization code flow
    - `AUTH_TYPE_AUTHORIZATION_CODE_PKCE` - Authorization code with PKCE
    - `AUTH_TYPE_IMPLICIT` - Implicit grant (legacy)
    - `AUTH_TYPE_PASSWORD` - Password credentials grant
    - `AUTH_TYPE_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` - Client credentials grant
  - All old methods (`getConnectionConfig`, `refreshTokenFromSession`, `refreshTokenFromServiceKey`) remain optional for backward compatibility

### Changed
- **ITokenProvider Interface**: Extended with optional `getTokens()` method
  - Old stateless methods are now optional (marked with `?`)
  - New stateful `getTokens()` method is optional (marked with `?`)
  - Allows gradual migration from old to new API

## [0.2.7] - 2025-12-22

### Changed
- **Migrated to Biome**: Replaced ESLint/Prettier with Biome for linting and formatting
  - Added `@biomejs/biome` as dev dependency (^2.3.10)
  - Added `biome.json` configuration file with recommended rules
  - Added npm scripts: `lint`, `lint:check`, `format`
  - Updated `build` script to include Biome check before TypeScript compilation
  - All code now follows Biome formatting and linting rules

### Fixed
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Replaced `any` types with `unknown` for better type safety
  - `IAbapRequestOptions.data` and `IAbapRequestOptions.params`: Changed from `any` to `unknown`
  - `ILogger` interface methods (`info`, `error`, `warn`, `debug`): Changed `meta` parameter from `any` to `unknown`
  - `IAbapConnection.AxiosResponse` type: Changed from `any` to `unknown` (type alias to avoid axios dependency)
  - `isNetworkError()` function: Changed parameter type from `any` to `unknown` with proper type guards
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused imports
  - Removed unused `AxiosResponse` import from `IAdtObject.ts`
  - Removed unused `IConnectionConfig` import from `ITokenProvider.ts`

## [0.2.6] - 2025-12-21

### Removed
- **IAbapConnectionExtended**: Removed deprecated interface completely
  - No backward compatibility - all consumers must use `IAbapConnection`
  - Migration: Replace `IAbapConnectionExtended` with `IAbapConnection` in your code
  - Methods `getConfig()`, `getAuthHeaders()`, `connect()`, `reset()` no longer in public interface

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **ITokenRefresher Interface**: New interface for dependency injection of token refresh logic into connections
  - `getToken(): Promise<string>` - Get current valid token (cached or refreshed)
  - `refreshToken(): Promise<string>` - Force refresh token and save to session store
  - Created by `AuthBroker.createTokenRefresher(destination)` and injected into `JwtAbapConnection`
  - Enables connections to handle 401/403 errors transparently without knowing about auth internals
  - Exported from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` in token domain

### Changed
- **IAbapConnection Simplified**: Removed implementation details from interface, keeping only consumer-facing methods
  - Removed `getConfig()` - internal implementation detail
  - Removed `getAuthHeaders()` - handled internally by `makeAdtRequest()`
  - Removed `connect()` - handled internally, connection established on first request
  - Removed `reset()` - internal method for token refresh logic
  - Kept: `getBaseUrl()`, `getSessionId()`, `setSessionType()`, `makeAdtRequest()`
  - This change simplifies the interface for consumers who only need to make requests

### Deprecated
- **IAbapConnectionExtended**: Added for backward compatibility, extends `IAbapConnection` with removed methods
  - `getConfig()`, `getAuthHeaders()`, `connect()`, `reset()`
  - Will be removed in next major version
  - Use `IAbapConnection` for new code

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Headless Browser Mode**: Added `"headless"` option to `ITokenProviderOptions.browser`
  - `"headless"`: Does not open browser, logs authentication URL and waits for manual callback
  - Ideal for SSH sessions, remote terminals, and environments without display
  - Differs from `"none"` which immediately rejects (for automated tests)
  - Updated JSDoc documentation for browser option with all supported values

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Store Error Codes**: Added standardized error codes for store operations
  - `STORE_ERROR_CODES` - Object containing error codes for store failures:
    - `FILE_NOT_FOUND` - Service key or session file not found
    - `PARSE_ERROR` - JSON or YAML parsing failed
    - `INVALID_CONFIG` - Required configuration fields are missing
    - `STORAGE_ERROR` - File write or permission error
  - `StoreErrorCode` - Type for store error codes
  - These constants enable auth-stores to provide typed errors to auth-broker
  - Error codes help broker distinguish between file not found, parsing errors, and validation failures
  - Exported from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` package in store domain

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Token Provider Error Codes**: Added standardized error codes for token provider operations
  - `TOKEN_PROVIDER_ERROR_CODES` - Object containing error codes for token provider failures:
    - `VALIDATION_ERROR` - Authentication configuration validation failed
    - `REFRESH_ERROR` - Token refresh operation failed
    - `SESSION_DATA_ERROR` - Session data is invalid or incomplete
    - `SERVICE_KEY_ERROR` - Service key data is invalid or incomplete
    - `BROWSER_AUTH_ERROR` - Browser authentication failed or was cancelled

  - These constants enable consistent error handling across token providers and auth-broker
  - Error codes help distinguish between different types of authentication failures
  - Exported from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` package in token domain

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Token Refresh Methods in ITokenProvider**: Added two new methods to `ITokenProvider` interface for explicit refresh scenarios
  - `refreshTokenFromSession(authConfig, options?)` - Refresh token using refresh token from session
    - Uses refresh token from `authConfig.refreshToken` to get new access token
    - Typically uses refresh_token grant type or browser-based re-authentication
    - Returns new authorization token and optional new refresh token
  - `refreshTokenFromServiceKey(authConfig, options?)` - Refresh token using UAA credentials from service key
    - Uses UAA credentials (uaaUrl, uaaClientId, uaaClientSecret) without refresh token
    - Typically uses browser-based authorization flow to ensure proper role assignment
    - Returns new authorization token and optional refresh token
  - These methods provide explicit control over token refresh strategy in AuthBroker
  - Allows separation of refresh-by-session vs refresh-by-service-key logic in token providers

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **Network Error Detection Constants and Utility**: Added network error codes and helper function for detecting infrastructure-level connection issues
  - `NETWORK_ERROR_CODES` - Object containing standard network error codes:
    - `ECONNREFUSED` - Connection refused (server not accepting connections)
    - `ETIMEDOUT` - Connection timeout (server not responding)
    - `ENOTFOUND` - DNS resolution failed (hostname not found)
    - `ECONNRESET` - Connection reset by peer
    - `ENETUNREACH` - Network is unreachable
    - `EHOSTUNREACH` - Host is unreachable
  - `NetworkErrorCode` - Type for network error codes
  - `isNetworkError(error: any): boolean` - Utility function to check if an error is a network-level error
  - These constants and utilities help distinguish network/infrastructure errors from application-level HTTP errors
  - Network errors should not trigger retry logic (CSRF, auth) as they indicate VPN, DNS, or connectivity issues
  - Exported from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` package in connection domain

## [0.1.19] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- **Low-level Update Mode in IAdtOperationOptions**: Added `lockHandle` field to `IAdtOperationOptions` interface
  - `lockHandle?: string` - Lock handle to use for low-level update operations
  - When `lockHandle` is provided in `update()` options, the method will skip lock, check, and unlock operations
  - Performs only the core update operation, useful when managing lock/unlock manually or in custom workflows
  - The update method assumes the object is already locked when `lockHandle` is provided

## [0.1.18] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- **Lock and Unlock Methods in IAdtObject Interface**: Added `lock()` and `unlock()` methods to `IAdtObject` interface
  - `lock(config: Partial<TConfig>): Promise<string>` - Lock object for modification, returns lock handle
  - `unlock(config: Partial<TConfig>, lockHandle: string): Promise<TReadResult>` - Unlock object using lock handle
  - These methods allow consumers to manually manage object locks for custom update workflows
  - Lock sets connection to stateful mode, unlock sets it back to stateless mode
  - Lock handle must be used in subsequent unlock() and update operations

## [0.1.17] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **Basic Authentication Support for IConnectionConfig**: Added support for basic auth (username/password) in addition to JWT tokens
  - Added optional `username?: string` field for basic authentication (on-premise systems)
  - Added optional `password?: string` field for basic authentication (on-premise systems)
  - Added optional `authType?: 'basic' | 'jwt'` field to indicate authentication type
  - Made `authorizationToken` optional (required for JWT auth, optional for basic auth)
  - This enables on-premise systems to use `--mcp` parameter with basic auth instead of requiring JWT tokens

## [0.1.16] - 2025-12-13

### Changed
- **HTTP timeout docs**: Clarified `timeout` option in `IAdtOperationOptions` to explain behavior and mention `withLongPolling` interplay
- **VSCode spell checking**: Limited spell checker scope to project files to reduce false positives

## [0.1.15] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Long Polling Support for Read Operations**: Added optional `withLongPolling` parameter to all GET-based read methods
  - **IAdtObject Interface**:
    - `read(config, version?, options?)` - Added optional `options?: { withLongPolling?: boolean }` parameter
    - `readMetadata(config, options?)` - Added optional `options?: { withLongPolling?: boolean }` parameter
    - `readTransport(config, options?)` - Added optional `options?: { withLongPolling?: boolean }` parameter
  - **IBuilder Interface** (in `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`):
    - `read(version?, options?)` - Added optional `options?: { withLongPolling?: boolean }` parameter
  - **Usage**: When `withLongPolling: true` is specified, the request includes `?withLongPolling=true` query parameter
    - This allows the server to hold the connection open until the object becomes available or a timeout occurs
    - Useful after create/activate operations to wait until object is ready for reading
    - Can replace timeout-based polling in tests and production code
  - **Example**:
    ```typescript
    // Wait for object to become available after creation
    const domain = await adtDomain.read(
      { domainName: 'Z_TEST' },
      'active',
      { withLongPolling: true }
    );
    
    // Read metadata with long polling
    const metadata = await adtDomain.readMetadata(
      { domainName: 'Z_TEST' },
      { withLongPolling: true }
    );
    ```

## [0.1.14] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **LogLevel Enum**: Added `LogLevel` enum to logging domain exports
  - Defines log levels: `ERROR = 0`, `WARN = 1`, `INFO = 2`, `DEBUG = 3`
  - Exported from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces` for use across all packages
  - Allows logger implementations to use standardized log level constants
  - **Usage**: `import { LogLevel } from '@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces';`

## [0.1.13] - 2025-12-19

### Removed
- **Unit Test and Transport Config Types**: Removed `IUnitTestBuilderConfig` and `ITransportBuilderConfig` from package exports
  - These types are now defined locally in `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` package as `IUnitTestConfig` and `ITransportConfig`
  - This change aligns with the pattern used by all other ADT object types (Class, Program, Interface, etc.) which have local Config types
  - **Migration**: If you were importing these types from `@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces`, update your imports to use local types from `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`:
    - `IUnitTestBuilderConfig` → `IUnitTestConfig` from `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients/src/core/unitTest/types`
    - `ITransportBuilderConfig` → `ITransportConfig` from `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients/src/core/transport/types`
  - **Note**: `IClassUnitTestDefinition` and `IClassUnitTestRunOptions` remain exported from this package as they are shared types

## [0.1.12] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- **IAdtObject Interface - Metadata Reading**: Added `readMetadata()` method to `IAdtObject` interface
  - `readMetadata(config: Partial<TConfig>): Promise<TReadResult>` - Reads object metadata (characteristics: package, responsible, description, etc.)
  - For objects with source code (Class, Interface, Program), reads metadata separately from source code
  - For objects without source code (Domain, DataElement), may delegate to `read()` as `read()` already returns metadata
  - Returns state with metadata result in `metadataResult` field
- **IAdtObjectState - Metadata Result Field**: Added `metadataResult?: AxiosResponse` field to `IAdtObjectState`
  - Stores metadata read result from `readMetadata()` method
  - Contains object characteristics (package, responsible, description, etc.)

## [0.1.11] - 2025-12-10

### Changed
- **IAdtObjectConfig Interface - Common Fields**: Extended `IAdtObjectConfig` with common fields shared across all ADT object configurations
  - Added `packageName?: string` - Package name (required for create operations, optional for others)
  - Added `description?: string` - Description (required for create/validate operations, optional for others)
  - `transportRequest?: string` - Transport request (already existed)
  - All specific configuration types (e.g., `IAdtClassConfig`, `DomainBuilderConfig`) should extend `IAdtObjectConfig` to inherit these common fields

## [0.1.10] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- **IAdtObject Interface - Transport Request Reading**: Added `readTransport()` method to `IAdtObject` interface
  - `readTransport(config: Partial<TConfig>): Promise<TReadResult>` - Reads transport request information for the object
  - Returns state with transport result in `transportResult` field
  - Allows consumers to query transport request details for any ADT object

## [0.1.9] - 2025-12-10

### Changed
- **IAdtObject Interface - Unified Return Types**: All methods now return `Promise<TReadResult>` instead of mixed types
  - `validate()`: Changed from `Promise<AxiosResponse>` to `Promise<TReadResult>`
  - `check()`: Changed from `Promise<AxiosResponse>` to `Promise<TReadResult>`
  - `activate()`: Changed from `Promise<AxiosResponse>` to `Promise<TReadResult>`
  - `delete()`: Changed from `Promise<AxiosResponse>` to `Promise<TReadResult>`
  - This provides consistent return types across all IAdtObject methods
  - State types (e.g., `ClassBuilderState`) should include fields for all operation results

## [0.1.8] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- **ADT Object Error Codes**: Added `AdtObjectErrorCodes` constants for error handling
  - Constants for all IAdtObject operation errors: `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`, `OBJECT_NOT_READY`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `CREATE_FAILED`, `UPDATE_FAILED`, `DELETE_FAILED`, `ACTIVATE_FAILED`, `CHECK_FAILED`, `LOCK_FAILED`, `UNLOCK_FAILED`
  - Allows consumers to catch specific errors by error code
  - Exported from package root: `import { AdtObjectErrorCodes } from '@mcp-abap-adt/interfaces'`

  - Unified interface for both create and update operations (replaces `CreateOptions` and `UpdateOptions`)
  - Includes all fields from both interfaces: `activateOnCreate`, `activateOnUpdate`, `deleteOnFailure`, `sourceCode`, `xmlContent`, `timeout`
  - `sourceCode` and `xmlContent` now available for update operations (previously only in create)
  - `timeout?: number` - Timeout for operations in milliseconds (default: 1000)
    - Prevents operation failures due to system not completing commands in time
    - Increase timeout for complex operations or slow systems

### Changed

### Breaking Changes

- **Session State Methods Removed from IAbapConnection**: Removed session state management methods from connection interface
  - `getSessionState()` method removed from `IAbapConnection`
  - `setSessionState()` method removed from `IAbapConnection`
  - Session state management is no longer a responsibility of connection package
  - Connection package now focuses solely on HTTP communication
  - Session state persistence should be handled by higher-level packages (e.g., auth-broker)

### Changed

- **Connection Package Scope**: Updated `IAbapConnection` interface to reflect connection package responsibilities
  - Connection package handles only HTTP communication and session headers
  - Token refresh is not a responsibility of connection package - handled by `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker` package
  - Session state persistence is not part of connection package scope

### Migration Guide

If you were using session state methods:

**Before (0.1.x)**:
```typescript
const state = connection.getSessionState();
connection.setSessionState(state);
```

**After (0.1.4)**:
```typescript
// Session state management is now handled by auth-broker or other higher-level packages
// Connection package only handles HTTP communication
```
